## Use This Skill When
- Use when this specialization is needed for the current task.
- Use when the task requires repeatable workflow guidance, not ad-hoc guessing.
- Use when working across any project, unless a stricter project or series scope applies.

## Safety Rules
- Prefer reversible, minimal changes first.
- Do not overwrite user content without explicit confirmation.
- Report assumptions and blockers instead of guessing hidden requirements.
- Keep sensitive data and credentials out of generated outputs.

## Output Contract
1. Clear execution summary for what was done and why.
2. Concrete deliverables (files, artifacts, or decisions) produced.
3. Validation status and remaining risks.
4. Exact next actions if further work is needed.
